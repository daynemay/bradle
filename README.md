It's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) but mean! It was created as a fork of [hello wordl](https://hellowordl.net).

Play it [**here**](https://bradle.daynemay.com/).

## Introduction

Wordle is a word game similar to the TV show [Lingo](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingo_(British_game_show)>).

You get 6 tries to guess a 5-letter target word. After each guess, the letters light up in various colors as clues. Green means a letter is correct in this spot; yellow means a letter is _elsewhere_ in the target word; gray means a letter is not in the target word at all.

## History

In 2021, Josh "powerlanguage" Wardle created _Wordle_, a version of the Lingo word game that you can play once a day. The target word is the same for everyone each day, and you can share results to Twitter and compare with your friends. This made Wordle [go absolutely viral](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html) around January 2022.

I wanted to make a silly version of the game to poke fun at a friend, so I created a version of it where the words could be taken as insults pertaining to that person.

## My word contained two of the same letter!

This can happen in Wordle too, and I give clues exactly the same way Wordle does. I think the game would be too easy if I got rid of double letters, so I won't.

## Where are the words coming from?

To generate target words, I have - with help - curated the list of target words used in [hello wordl](https://hellowordl.net) to a specific (silly) set of words. I doubt anyone's playing enough to get dealt a strange target word, but if it becomes an issue, please [let me know](https://github.com/daynemay/bradle/issues/new).
